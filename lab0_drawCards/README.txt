This was the first project of the semester. The program simulates a standard 52 card deck(No Jokers).
The program will output an array of each card in the deck with the number of times each card has been 
drawn under it. It will also display the probability of each card to be drawn. 
The user has two choices:
   1 - Draw a Card. (The program will randomly draw one card)
   0 - Exit the Program.
Each time the user draws a card from the deck, the probability table will update to show the new probability
of each card.

The purpose of this lab was to implement modules in C++ by creating different header and cpp files 
associated with different tasks.

This project also introduced creating simple graphics.

The code will allow the user to choose how many balls they would like to
bounce in the square. The user also has the option to choose the amount 
of iterations the program will loop through.

#Note
This project will only run on windows due to the windows.h file used.
Part of the code was given to us by the professor as well. I have anotated my code.

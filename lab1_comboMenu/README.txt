This was a simple project where we were asked to create a simple food ordering menu.

The user is given the option to print the menu to the screen so they can see what they're 
ordering. If the user chooses to create a combo of three items, they receive a discount. Each combo 
created will be saved. When the user chooses to print the menu, they will be shown the combos they
have created and the price they owe.
